# Hey-this-is-fun
I feel pretty excited making my first repository.
My name is John Michael Nicholson and I am studying Computer Science at San Antonio College.
I have coded in html and javascript, but plans to work with c++ and java soon.
I am a musician.
I love learning languages.
I love to travel.
Math, science, history, literature, philosophy, all that good stuff! <3
I hope to learn a lot from this website! :)
